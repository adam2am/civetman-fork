# Contributor Guide

Civetman does have a lot of problems. If you spotted any errors, you can open an issue.

Civetman is built with Civet. The main file is [here](https://github.com/zihan-ch/civetman/blob/main/cli/src/main.civet).

To start developing, you need to get `pnpm` installed (run `corepack enable` to install it). Then, run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies, then run `pnpm dev` to start developing.

The versions are managed with Changesets. See their [official guide](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-using-changesets.md) to learn how to use it.
